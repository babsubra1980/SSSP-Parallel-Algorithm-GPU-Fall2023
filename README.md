SSSP stands for Single-Source Shortest Path, which is a fundamental algorithm in graph theory. The primary purpose of the SSSP algorithm is to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. The "shortest path" in this context refers to the path with the minimum sum of weights. We assume that all weights are non-negative for the present report. If we view the weights as representing a cost (such as money or time) associated with one segment (edge) of the overall path, then the SSSP problem can be thought of as an optimization problem whereby we seek the minimal cost (and the associated path). It is also possible to think of this problem geometrically, in the case where a finite discretization is known for a smooth two-dimensional manifold (such as the Earthâ€™s surface, accounting for the geometry of hills, valleys, etc.). Such a discretization typically arises as the disjoint union of (open) triangles, (open) lines, and points, known as a cell complex, and the edge weights are then just determined by the local metric (assuming the discretization is sufficiently fine). Then the shortest paths emanating from a source vertex simply represent approximations of the geodesics emanating from the corresponding point on the manifold (although this interpretation only applies to geodesics that are not too far from their corresponding discretized paths: namely, the local angle between the true geodesic and its approximating path must not be too large at any point).
